BIOL-1308,The Microbial Mothership,"Chemical, geological and fossil data suggest that the earth is about 4.5 billion years old, and that bacterial life was present on earth for at least 3 billion years before any evidence of humans is found.  The emergence of complex multicellular organisms such as humans has taken place in intimate association with microbial communities; and the present-day human-microbe association, the ""metaorganism"", is the product of an expansive and complex coevolutionary process.  We have only recently begun to recognize the complexity and importance of the interrelationships that have evolved over millennia between human and animal cells and their associated microbial communities.  In this course we will develop a framework to aid our understanding of the species diversity and critical interspecies dependencies (microbe-microbe and microbe-human) that comprise the human microbial mothership.  We will explore the tools and technologies used to characterize and analyze complex microbial communities.

Thus, the writings of Darwin transformed our understanding of the dynamic natural world. His ideas have further shaped the fields of medicine, agriculture, and social policy, and motivated great works of art and literature. This discussion-based course will explore the development of Darwin's revolutionary ideas through a survey of his life, his major written works, and the influence of his writing on modern thinking.

CLAS-3310,Antiquity and Diversity in Contemporary Literature,"In this seminar, we explore how contemporary  American literature articulates issues in  diversity and identity via themes, stories, and  images drawn from classical (Greek and Roman)  antiquity. Far from being 'dead letters'  belonging solely to 'dead white men,' the  classics are important sources of inspiration and  creativity--as well as controversy and  debate--for authors representing diverse American  identities today, including African-American,  Latinx, LGBTQ, Native American,  religious  minorities, regional identities, and more. To  consider diversity in such categories as race and  ethnicity, social class, gender and sexuality,  immigration, regional identity, and religion, we  focus on American literature since World War II,  in connection with the most relevant ancient  sources, in comparison with films, and in  contexts of scholarship and criticism.

Stories from the ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern worlds have been important sources for cinema since the invention of film as a medium in the late 19th century, and likewise movies, television shows, and other video formats have been among the most influential vehicles for modern imaginations of antiquity. We explore this rich area by considering roughly a dozen feature-length films, several episodes of television shows, and shorter pieces all spanning 120 years of cinema (including early and silent films), in connection with a wide range of ancient texts (mostly Greek and Roman, some Near Eastern) and in context of modern scholarship (classical-reception studies, film studies).

CLAS-3350,Theorizing Myth,"A survey of theoretical approaches to myth from the eighteenth century to the present.  This survey begins with the transition from renaissance belief that myth is a form of moral instruction conveyed by allegory to the romantic belief that myth is a symbolic mode of discourse offering insight into transcendental reality.  We will then chart the evolution of this approach, beginning with its inspiration in Kantian metaphysics and early formulations by German romantics such as Schiller and proceeding on to Freud and Ricoeur. A second strand begins with Hegel's theories of ""false consciousness"" that would in time develop into interpretations of myth as ideology , under the influence of Marx, Adorno, and Althusser.  A final strand begins with the earlier folklorists, the brothers Grimm, and would in time develop into functionalist approaches to myth by anthropologists such as Malinowski, Boas, and Levi-Strauss.  The resulting big picture is as much an intellectual history of modernity as a history of theorizing myth. (Also listed as PHIL 3361.)  Prerequisites: Sophomore standing or consent of instructor."

Approaching early American politics from diverse perspectives allows us to consider from many historical angles: why the right to free speech and petition was the first freedom enshrined in the Bill of Rights, how individuals interpreted and attempted to expand the definition of ""we the people,"" and what role a free press played in the founding of the United States.

HIST-3442,American Migrant Cities,"This course interrogates ""migrant cities"" in the Americas, that is, cities that grew and developed in relationship to the movement of millions of peoples across regions, borders, and oceans. We will consider three broad migrations: 1) European migrations to Atlantic metropoles such as New York, Buenos Aires, and São Paulo between 1870 and 1930; 2) internal migrations of people (including of African and Indigenous descent) from the U.S. South to northern cities; from the Brazilian northeast to its southern industrial cities; and from peasant communities to cities such as Lima and Mexico City; 3) finally, we will study the South-North migration from Mexico and Central America to the U.S. between 1970 and the present. By comparing these migrations in the United States and Latin America, we will explore how the movement of people has shaped cities across the hemisphere and we will interrogate the commonalities and common histories of both regions. In the process, we will challenge several myths about the United States and Latin America: Is the U.S. ""melting pot"" truly exceptional or has the whole continent been impacted by migrations across regions and borders? Have cities represented spaces of opportunity and liberation for migrants or are they sites where inequality and oppression have simply adopted a different form? How does legal status, race/ethnicity, and economic conditions influence how migrants fare in their new cities? Is the presence of Latinos in U.S. cities a new phenomenon or and an old one? Does this presence represent a threat, an opportunity, or more of the same?"

Centering our study on the influential depiction of the underworld in Virgil's Aeneid, we examine a wide range of authors including Homer (Odyssey), Plato ('The Myth of Er'), Aristophanes (The Frogs), Ovid (Metamorphoses); Dante (Inferno), Shakespeare (The Tempest), Jules Verne (Journey to the Center of the Earth), Lewis Carroll (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland); J.

Beginning with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1818), evoking antiquity in its subtitle, The Modern Prometheus, we consider a wide range of materials--mainly literature and film--from several theoretical perspectives in the fields of SF studies and Classics. Readings from modern authors including Kafka, Borges, Herbert, Le Guin, and Dick; ancient authors including Homer, Aeschylus, Lucretius, Ovid, and Lucian; and screenings from directors including Wilcox, Tarkovsky, Kubrick, Cronenberg, and Scott.
